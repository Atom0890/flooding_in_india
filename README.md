# Flooding in India
This project aims to analyze and construe floods in India over the years, in order to identify
the relevant features and then build a predictive flood model. Thanks to these information,
we could extract some insights for policy makers and apply flood control measures at the
end. The final predictive model must indicate if floods will occur or not, based on a bunch of
parameters calculated throughout machine learning.
